# Periodic Decoder

Periodic Decoder is a C project that takes numeric input and generates all possible word combinations using atomic symbols from the periodic table. Each number corresponds to an atomic number, and the program converts these numbers into atomic symbols to create meaningful words.

## Features
- Input any sequence of numbers corresponding to atomic numbers.
- Generate all possible combinations of words using atomic symbols.
- Works with the entire periodic table of elements.
- Explore chemistry in a fun, gamified way.

## How it Works
1. Enter a sequence of numbers.
2. Each number will be matched with the atomic symbol of the corresponding element.
3. The program generates and prints out all possible word combinations that can be formed from those symbols.
